# Simas's Personal Website

Simas's Personal Website is my first milestone project for Code Institute. This website is a good way to find out more about me, discover my work and reach out to me. I's designed to be responsive for all screen sizes.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

I went for a dark themed website as it is easier on the eye. I also wanted to separate the sections by adding contrast via alternating between dark and  brighter backgrounds. So I came up with a custom palette.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to chose and import fonts for use in the site.

I have chosen to use Barlow font for the body of the website as I thought it's great for accesibility especialy with larger volume of text. Oswald font for the headings and menu makes them look neat and sharp. I decided to use Tektur font for the greating message on the landing page as the message has typing animation and the font reminds me of something generated by computer.

### Wireframes

Due to suggestions from my mentor and me experimenting with the code I deviated quite heavily from the initial layout of the website. These are the original wireframes for the 3 page website:
