# Simas's Personal Website

Simas's Personal Website is my first milestone project for Code Institute. This website is a good way to find out more about me, discover my work and reach out to me. I's designed to be responsive for all screen sizes.

## User Experience (UX)

### Project Developer Goals

My goal is to display my work and skill level for potential employer, someone wishing to collaborate on future projects or simply reach out and chat about a shared interest ('My Interests' section will be added in future updates).

### First Time Visitor Goals

* I want to immediately understand the purpose of the website.
* I want to be able to navigate the website effortlessly uppon first visit.
* I want to be able to find the information I'm looking for easily.
* I want to be able to view other projects from this website developer.
* I want to be able to visit the developer's GitHub account to observe the level of activity there and quality of the code on their other projects.
* I want to be able to contact the developer of this website if I wish to do so.
* I want the website to be responsive to the device I'm using.

### Returning Visitor Goals

* I want to see if there are new projects in developer's portfolio.
* I want to see if theres new additions to developer's GitHub account.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

I went for a dark themed website as it is easier on the eye. I also wanted to separate the sections by adding contrast via alternating between dark and  brighter backgrounds. So I came up with a custom palette.

![color-palette](https://github.com/SimasJakubenas/PersonalWebsite/assets/138577499/7a1a9671-c97d-4bbc-977e-8ce3edaec12e)

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to chose and import fonts for use in the site.

I have chosen to use Barlow font for the body of the website as I thought it's great for accesibility especialy with larger volume of text. Oswald font for the headings and menu makes them look neat and sharp. I decided to use Tektur font for the greating message on the landing page as the message has typing animation and the font reminds me of something generated by computer.

### Wireframes

Due to suggestions from my mentor and me experimenting with the code I deviated quite heavily from the initial layout of the website. These are the original wireframes for the 3 page website:

## Features

A website is a one continuous page. It consists of 6 sections: home, bio, education, skills, work experience, contact me.

The website has a favicon that is a picture of me.

### Accessibility

These are accessibility features I was midful of during the coding process:
* Semantic HTML
* Using descriptive alt atributes for any pictures included.
* Providing meaningful descriptions for screen readers where icons/links are used.
* Ensuring adequate contrast between text and background across the website.
